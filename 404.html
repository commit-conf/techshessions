        <p>Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming was a Scottish astronomer. During her career, she helped develop a common designation system for stars and cataloged thousands of stars and other astronomical phenomena. Among several career achievements that advanced astronomy, Fleming is noted for her discovery of the Horsehead Nebula in 1888.</p>

      <quote>
        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage&#39;s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a &#34;computing machine&#34; and one of the first computer programmers.</p>

        <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL.</p>

        <p>Mary Allen Wilkes is a former computer programmer and logic designer, most known for her work with the LINC computer, now recognized by many as the world&#39;s first &#34;personal computer&#34;. Initially, Wilkes planned to be lawyer, but was discouraged by friends and mentors from pursuing law because of the challenges women faced in the field. A geography teacher in the eighth grade had told Wilkes, &#34;Mary Allen, when you grow up, you ought to be a computer programmer.&#34; She worked in the field as one of the first programmers for a number of years before pursuing law and becoming an attorney in 1975.</p>

      <quote>
        <p>Adele Goldberg is a computer scientist who participated in developing the programming language Smalltalk-80 and various concepts related to object-oriented programming while a researcher at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), in the 1970s.
Many of the concepts developed by Goldberg and her team at PARC became the basis for graphically based user interfaces, replacing the earlier command line based systems. Apple eventually used many of the ideas in the Alto and their implementations as the basis for their Apple Macintosh desktop environment.</p>

      <quote>
        <p>Ball was a successful entrepreneur who was the first person of any gender to run a commercially viable computer dating service in either the UK or the USA. Her company predated Harvard&#39;s &#34;Operation Match&#34; by a year and preceded the other major British computer dating company, Dateline (run by John Patterson). Com-Pat operated under Ball&#39;s management for nearly a decade, until she was eventually bought out by Dateline in 1974. Ball&#39;s experience shows that, contrary to popular narratives on the web, women were in fact early pioneers in the field of computer dating and social networking by computer.</p>

      <quote>
        <p>Karen Spärck Jones FBA was a pioneering British computer scientist. Her main research interests, since the late 1950s, were natural language processing and information retrieval. One of her most important contributions was the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting in information retrieval, which she introduced in a 1972 paper. IDF is used in most search engines today, usually as part of the tf-idf weighting scheme.</p>
